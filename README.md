# AI-Study-Planner-Group8
The AI Study Planner is a web-based tool that uses Generative AI to automatically create and validate university study plans. It processes unstructured course data to generate a draft plan, allows students to customise it via drag-and-drop, checks rules in real time, and exports the final plan to PDF â€” all without requiring a login.
